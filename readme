# Color finder exe

This console application has only one purpose, telling you if an input image has one or more pixels of a given color range.

An example of how to use it is the following command:

        colorfinder.exe imageHasColor c:\path\to\your\image.png 0,255,0,10,20,20 show

In this setting, the application will let you know if the image has pixels of the given color setting (BGR) with 10,20 and 20 tolerance 
for each color channel. 

There are other modes of operation, such as selecting a region of interest, and get the color data on that region.

You can use the following command:
        colorfinder.exe colorFilter_mouse c:\path\to\your\image.png 
Which let you select a region of interest using your mouse and will get the colors of that region, and filter the original image to display only those
colors in the ROI 
The software will calculate what is the most common color value in that region, along with the standar deviation 

You can type colorfinder.exe help -h for a list of all of the available commands
